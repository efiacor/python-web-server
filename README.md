Simple Python Web Server
========================

Running the server from a terminal:

```
python serv.py
```

Or, run it from your IDE (I prefer Pycharm community edition)

Open a browser on localhost:8080 to view the index.html/landing page.

With the http server running, we can update the html live and refresh the browser to see the changes.
